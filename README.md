# Uber-ride-reviews

Uber ride review analysis is a Supervised Learning Classification problem where I try to classify the ride
reviews given by the people as Positive (1) or Negative (0) based on the ride rating.

Uber ride reviews is an integral part of the Uber System which puts the entire transaction in check leading
to a significantly more pleasant & safer service. This classification of ride reviews will help Uber to better
tackle the public problems related to uber such as uber not being on time, driver not good, quality of the
car is bad & multiple uber drive cancellation issues.


I got the dataset from Kaggle, the size of the data is around 15-20 mb which consist of 1300 rows & has
3 features ride review (text), ride rating (numerical), ride sentiment(numerical). Ride sentiment is our
target feature having 2 classes 1 & 0. I will be using ride review & ride rating feature to classify the ride
sentiment as positive or negative


I have used ML models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision
Trees for the project. Quality of the model has been  accessed using various performance metrics for
classification such as Confusion matrix, AUC ROC Curve, Recall, Accuracy & Precision.
